WAKE_WORD="potato" # Wake word for voice activation
SILENCE_THRESHOLD=1.2 # Silence threshold in seconds to detect end of speech 
SLEEP_WORDS="stop,go to sleep,goodbye,exit, okay thanks, thank you, done, enough" # Comma-separated list of words/phrases to put the assistant to sleep and terminate voice interaction as well as generation
RESET_CONTEXT_WORDS="reset context,new conversation,start over,clear history" # Comma-separated list of words/phrases to reset the conversation context during voice interaction

ENABLE_DISCORD_BOT=false
ENABLE_TTS=false # Text-to-Speech
ENABLE_STT=false # Speech-to-Text
ENABLE_SEARXNG_SEARCH=false # Enable web search using SearXNG API. false keeps it 100% local but not recommended. SearXNG is VERY privacy-respecting and Open-source. 
ENABLE_DANGEROUS_TOOLS=false # Enable potentially dangerous tools that can modify or delete files on your system. Use with caution, or sandboxed.
ENABLE_OLLAMA_STREAMING=true # Enable streaming responses from Ollama for faster response times in the web UI; may not be supported by all models OR all output modes. WebUI supports.
