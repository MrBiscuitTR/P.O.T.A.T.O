ENABLE_WEBUI_AUTH=true # Set to true to enable authentication for the web UI, recommended
WEBUI_USERNAME="" # Set your desired username for web UI authentication
WEBUI_PASSWORD="" # Set your desired password for web UI authentication
ACCEPT_TEXT_FILE_TYPES="txt,pdf,docx,md,doc," # Comma-separated list of accepted text-based file types for upload
ACCEPT_IMAGE_FILE_TYPES="png,jpg,jpeg,gif,bmp,pbm,pgm,ppm,avif,heic,webp" # Comma-separated list of accepted image file types for upload

#BOOLS
ENABLE_HISTORY=true # Enable chat history saving and retrieval
RESET_HISTORY_ON_START=false # Reset chat history when the application starts (turn on for private mode)
SAVE_SENT_FILES=false # Save files sent by users in chats
ENABLE_FILE_UPLOAD=true # Enable file upload functionality in the web UI
ENABLE_FOLDER_UPLOAD=true # Enable folder upload functionality in the web UI
ENABLE_CODE_UPLOAD=true # Enable code file upload functionality in the web UI
ENABLE_IMAGE_PROCESSING=true # Enable image processing capabilities (e.g., OCR, image analysis)
ENABLE_SENT_URLS=true # Enable processing of URLs sent by users in chats

USE_LATEX_RENDERING=true # Enable LaTeX rendering for mathematical expressions in responses

ENABLE_DISCORD_BOT=false
ENABLE_TTS=false # Text-to-Speech
ENABLE_STT=false # Speech-to-Text
ENABLE_SEARXNG_SEARCH=false # Enable web search using SearXNG API. false keeps it 100% local but not recommended. SearXNG is VERY privacy-respecting and Open-source. 
ENABLE_DANGEROUS_TOOLS=false # Enable potentially dangerous tools that can modify or delete files on your system. Use with caution, or sandboxed.
ENABLE_OLLAMA_STREAMING=true # Enable streaming responses from Ollama for faster response times in the web UI; may not be supported by all models OR all output modes. WebUI supports.
ENABLE_AGENTS=false # Enable agent functionalities for more complex tasks. Agents can use tools and manage context more effectively.
ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_MODE=false # Enable autonomous mode for the assistant to perform tasks without user intervention. Use with caution.
ENABLE_DEVICE_CONTROL=false # Enable device control functionalities. Use with caution.
ENABLE_LOGS=true # Enable logging of interactions and events for debugging and analysis.
ENABLE_ALWAYS_HITL=false # Enable Always Human-in-the-Loop mode for continuous human oversight. Safe to use if user is careful.
IDIOT_MODE=false # Enable idiot mode for simplified interactions and reduced complexity. Safe to use. Can cause no harm, but also reduces capabilities.
